I am a Research Assistant at the School of Computer Science and Engineering,  Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof Cong Gao](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/). My research interests mainly lie in the field of machine learning for databases, where we study the application of machine learning techniques into various problems in databases, like indexing, query optimization, and data generation.

I graduated from Nanyang Technological University in 2022 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science (Honours Highest Distinction).
