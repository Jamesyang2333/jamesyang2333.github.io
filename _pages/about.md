I am a PhD student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering,  Nanyang Technological University, supervised by [Prof Cong Gao](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/). My research interests mainly lie in the field of machine learning and databases.

I graduated from Nanyang Technological University in 2021 with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science (Honours Highest Distinction) and a minor in Mathematics.
